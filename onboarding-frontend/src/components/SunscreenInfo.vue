    <h1 class="title">Introduction to Sunscreen</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Sunscreen is an essential protective measure that helps shield the skin
      from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, effectively reducing the risk of
      sunburn, premature skin aging, and skin cancer, including melanoma.
    </p>
    <p>
      UV radiation is divided into UVA and UVBâ€”UVA primarily causes skin aging
      and deep tissue damage, while UVB is responsible for sunburn and is
      closely linked to the development of skin cancer. Proper sunscreen
      application includes using an adequate amount (about a teaspoon for the
      face and a shot-glass amount for the body), reapplying every two hours,
      and selecting broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect against both UVA and UVB
      rays.

      Additionally, wearing protective clothing, avoiding direct sun exposure,
      and using sunglasses can further enhance sun protection. With the rising
      global incidence of skin cancer, incorporating sunscreen into daily
      skincare routines not only helps prevent sunburn but also slows down skin
      aging and protects overall skin health, making it an essential habit in
      modern skincare.
